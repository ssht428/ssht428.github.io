#STRONG March 2012 – July 2012 		Multiaxial Warp Knitting Machine #-STRONG
Project Description: The Multiaxial Warp Knitting Machine equips with a weft insertion device and a warp knitting machine. Weft yarns are drawn by weft filling wagon, and then sent into weft clamping devices that in both sides of the machine. Through carousel conveyor, weft yarns will be delivered to the knitting station to form fabrics. 
Responsibility: Designed take-up device for great roll diameter of fabric include mechanical design, PLC and HMI software.

#STRONG May 2011 - Nov. 2011 	Sliding Revolving Door #-STRONG
Project Description: This sliding-revolving door was original designed by Panasonic, but there were always some problems after installation. So changed parts of the control system and sensors on the door, and re-designed the control software for it.
Responsibility: The whole project proposal, I/O and sensor adjusting, PC/PLC programming, ECAD drawing, user/maintenance manuals and so on.

#STRONG Aug. 2010 - March 2011 	Modern Motor Control Laboratory #-STRONG
Project Description: This laboratory was built by B&R and Shandong University, for teaching students the knowledge of motor and automatic control principle. Three different motors (asynchronous / synchronous / linear) were droved by kinds of servo driver.
Responsibility: Designed the entire instructional software.

#STRONG Dec. 2008 - Nov. 2009 	Product Management System #-STRONG
Project Description: Designed PMS to standardize the process of hardware testing and repairing, and the efficiency and quality of after-service improved 67%. And also provided information about all return-products to each departments and offices, and decreased the cost of communication and paper.
Responsibility: The whole software’s architecture and database design, and wrote the code for all the functions.
